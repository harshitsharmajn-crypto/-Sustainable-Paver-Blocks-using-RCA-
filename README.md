# Sustainable-Paver-Blocks-using-RCA

## Overview

This project explores an innovative method of utilizing **waste plastics** in the production of **paver blocks**. With the rapid increase in plastic waste generation in India (approximately 3.5 million tonnes annually), managing and recycling this waste has become a major environmental challenge.
The project demonstrates how **HDPE plastic waste**, when combined with sand, aggregates, and quarry dust, can be used to produce durable, cost-effective, and eco-friendly paver blocks.

## Objectives

* To manufacture paver blocks using HDPE plastic waste.
* To study the **compressive strength, water absorption, and melting point** of plastic paver blocks.
* To compare performance with conventional concrete paver blocks.
* To minimize environmental hazards caused by plastic waste.
* To produce affordable and sustainable construction materials.

---

## Scope

* Reduction of plastic waste in the environment.
* Promotes **recycling and resource efficiency**.
* Encourages self-employability through low-cost manufacturing.
* Provides a sustainable construction material alternative.

---

## Materials Used

* **HDPE Plastic Waste** (plastic bags, wrappers)
* **Sand** (fine aggregates, <4.75 mm)
* **Coarse Aggregates** (10–13.2 mm)
* **Recycled Concrete Aggregate (RCA)**

---

## Methodology

1. **Collection & Preparation**

   * Plastic waste collected from local areas.
   * Sand and aggregates sieved and pre-heated at 105°C to remove moisture.

2. **Plastic Melting**

   * HDPE plastic melted at 150–160°C until viscous.

3. **Mixing**

   * Melted plastic mixed with sand and aggregates in specific ratios.

4. **Casting**

   * Mixture poured into iron moulds and vibrated for compaction.
   * Blocks dried for 24 hours before testing.

## Mix Proportions

| Block Type   | Plastic | Sand | Aggregate |
| ------------ | ------- | ---- | --------- |
| Type 1       | 1       | 2    | 2         |
| Type 2 (RCA) | 1       | 2    | 2         |
| Type 3 (RCA) | 1.25    | 2    | 2         |

---

## Results

* **Compressive Strength**: \~10 N/mm² (higher than concrete paver blocks).
* **Melting Point**: Stable up to 150°C.
* **Water Absorption**: \~3% (lower than conventional concrete blocks).
* **Density**: 2500 kg/m³ (higher than concrete blocks at 2200 kg/m³).

---

## Advantages

* Lightweight and waterproof.
* Lower cost compared to traditional blocks.
* Reduces plastic waste pollution.
* Environmentally friendly and recyclable.
* Lower water absorption improves durability.

---

## Applications

* Garden pathways
* Pedestrian walkways
* Cycle tracks
* Non-traffic and light traffic roads

---

## Conclusion

Plastic paver blocks are a **sustainable, economical, and durable alternative** to conventional concrete blocks. By utilizing plastic waste effectively, this project provides a productive solution for waste management and contributes to cleaner and greener construction practices.
